# ml-attrition-analysis
A machine learning project undertaken by me to analyze attrition in a workplace.

We're given datasets for a company which lists out the employees working in the company as well as those who have left the company over a time period of 2018-2019.

The goal of this project is to analyze the reasons for attrition in various departments and try to predict which employees might leave the company in the future.

It is an excellent real world machine learning problem with actual data provided by a corporation.

The datasets may not be used without my explicit permission.
